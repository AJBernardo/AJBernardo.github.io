                    &emsp;&emsp;Venetian cuisine is characterized by its close connection to the lagoon, reflecting a
                    delicate
                    balance between land and sea. Its flavors are shaped by the natural bounty of the surrounding waters
                    and fertile islands, where seafood and local produce are central. The cuisine tends to be subtle and
                    restrained, often relying on a few well-chosen ingredients to create harmony in a dish. Seasonality
                    plays an important role, with ingredients like fresh vegetables, seafood, and meats being
                    highlighted during their peak times.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;There is also a notable historical influence from Venice’s position as a trading hub
                    during the
                    medieval period, resulting in the use of spices and exotic ingredients in many traditional recipes.
                    These influences brought a sense of warmth and complexity to dishes, blending Eastern and
                    Mediterranean flavors. Venetians also maintain a strong connection to communal dining, where small
                    plates and shared meals are common, reflecting a social, convivial aspect to their eating culture.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Throughout the cuisine, simple preparations are elevated by high-quality ingredients,
                    with an
                    emphasis on fresh, local produce and sustainable practices. The careful use of textures, from creamy
                    polentas to crisp vegetables, adds depth to each meal, while the dishes themselves often carry a
                    distinct sense of place, rooted in the maritime and agricultural heritage of the region.

        <h1 class="title">Here are the Top 10 Venetian Classics<br>You Must Try While You're in Venice</h1>
        <div class="row">
            <h1 class="dish-name">01 Sarde in Saor</h1>
            <img class="dish-photo" src="img/dish-1.png" alt="sarde-in-saor">
            <p class="dish-description">This dish features fried sardines that are marinated in a sauce made from vinegar, onions, raisins, and
                pine nuts. The combination of sweet and sour flavors is key to its uniqueness.
            </p>
            <p class="dish-description">
                "Saor" is a Venetian method of food preservation dating back to the Middle Ages when sailors needed food
                that would last long voyages. The vinegar preserved the sardines, while the onions and raisins added
                complexity. The dish perfectly balances sweetness from the raisins and the tartness from the vinegar,
                with a slight crunch from the pine nuts.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h1 class="dish-name">02 Risotto al Nero di Seppia</h1>
            <img class="dish-photo" src="img/dish-2.png" alt="sarde-in-saor">
            <p class="dish-description">A creamy risotto infused with the ink of cuttlefish, which gives it its signature black color. It’s typically served with tender pieces of cuttlefish.
            </p>
            <p class="dish-description">
                This dish exemplifies Venice’s deep connection to the sea. The ink provides a rich, briny flavor that’s slightly sweet, while the risotto’s creamy texture absorbs all the intense flavors of the sea. It's a striking dish both visually and in taste, making it a must-try for seafood lovers.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h1 class="dish-name">03 Bigoli in Salsa</h1>
            <img class="dish-photo" src="img/dish-3.png" alt="sarde-in-saor">
            <p class="dish-description">Bigoli is a thick, whole-wheat pasta similar to spaghetti but denser. It’s served with a savory sauce made from salted anchovies, onions, and olive oil.
            </p>
            <p class="dish-description">
                Bigoli is a traditional Venetian pasta, and this dish was originally a humble meal eaten on fasting days like Fridays or during Lent. The anchovy sauce is simple yet intensely flavorful, as the anchovies melt into the onions, creating a deep umami richness that clings to the thick strands of pasta.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h1 class="dish-name">04 Baccalà Mantecato</h1>
            <img class="dish-photo" src="img/dish-4.png" alt="sarde-in-saor">
            <p class="dish-description">Baccalà (salted cod) is soaked to remove the salt, then whipped with olive oil to form a light, fluffy, mousse-like spread. It’s typically served on toasted bread or polenta.
            </p>
            <p class="dish-description">
                Venetian traders imported dried cod from Norway as early as the 15th century, and over time, it became a staple. The whipping process creates a creamy texture without adding dairy, and the result is a delicate, slightly salty spread that melts in your mouth. It’s a wonderful blend of creamy and salty, perfect as an appetizer or snack.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h1 class="dish-name">05 Fegato alla Veneziana</h1>
            <img class="dish-photo" src="img/dish-5.png" alt="sarde-in-saor">
            <p class="dish-description">Thin slices of calf’s liver are sautéed with caramelized onions and typically served with soft polenta on the side.
            <p class="dish-description">
                A classic Venetian dish, the sweetness of the onions complements the strong, earthy flavor of the liver. Even if you’re not a fan of liver, the Venetian preparation may surprise you—cooked to perfection, the liver is tender and rich, while the onions provide a sweet counterbalance.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h1 class="dish-name">06 Moeche Fritte</h1>
            <img class="dish-photo" src="img/dish-6.png" alt="sarde-in-saor">
            <p class="dish-description">Moeche are tiny soft-shell crabs caught in the Venetian lagoon, which are fried until crispy. They’re usually served whole, often as a street food.
            </p>
            <p class="dish-description">
                Moeche are a seasonal delicacy, available only during the crabs' molting period in the spring and fall. The whole crabs, eaten shell and all, offer a delightful crunchy texture with a burst of briny, tender crab meat inside. They’re a rare treat and a must-try for seafood lovers.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h1 class="dish-name">07 Polenta e Schie</h1>
            <img class="dish-photo" src="img/dish-7.png" alt="sarde-in-saor">
            <p class="dish-description">Soft, creamy polenta is served with tiny lagoon shrimp (schie), which are usually sautéed in garlic and olive oil.
            </p>
            <p class="dish-description">
                Venice has long relied on the lagoon for its seafood, and this dish exemplifies the city’s resourcefulness. The sweet, delicate shrimp pair beautifully with the smooth, slightly earthy flavor of the polenta. It’s a simple dish but one that showcases the bounty of the Venetian lagoon.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h1 class="dish-name">08 Cicchetti</h1>
            <img class="dish-photo" src="img/dish-8.png" alt="sarde-in-saor">
            <p class="dish-description">Cicchetti are small snacks or side dishes served in traditional Venetian wine bars (bacari). They range from crostini topped with baccalà mantecato to fried seafood, marinated vegetables, or meatballs.
            </p>
            <p class="dish-description">
                Cicchetti are Venice’s answer to tapas, and they’re meant to be enjoyed alongside a glass of local wine or a spritz. These small bites allow you to taste a variety of local flavors, from the sea to the farm, in a casual, social setting. It’s the perfect way to graze through Venetian cuisine.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h1 class="dish-name">09 Fritole</h1>
            <img class="dish-photo" src="img/dish-9.png" alt="sarde-in-saor">
            <p class="dish-description">These are small, round fried doughnuts filled with raisins, pine nuts, or pastry cream, and dusted with powdered sugar.
            </p>
            <p class="dish-description">
                Fritole were originally created as a treat for the Venice Carnival and are still associated with the festive season. They’re light, airy, and sweet, with just a hint of nuttiness from the pine nuts and raisins.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h1 class="dish-name">10 Baicoli</h1>
            <img class="dish-photo" src="img/dish-10.png" alt="sarde-in-saor">
            <p class="dish-description">Baicoli are dry, crunchy biscuits that were traditionally eaten by sailors due to their long shelf life. Today, they’re served as a snack or dessert, often with coffee or dessert wine.
            </p>
            <p class="dish-description">
                These simple, lightly sweet biscuits have been around since the 18th century. While not flashy, they’re a reminder of Venice’s maritime past and are perfect for dipping into your coffee or a glass of Vin Santo.
