                    extraordinary team. From Chisato’s
                    cheerful charm to Takina’s quiet precision, Kurumi’s tech wizardry, Mizuki’s spirited sass, and
                    Mika’s steady hand — each staff
                    member brings their own unique flavor to the café. Together, they make Café LycoReco more than just
                    a place
                    to eat — it’s a place to feel at home.</p>

                <p class="body px-3 px-md-0 ps-xl-5 mt-5" style="font-weight: 500;">Chisato is the heart and soul of Café LycoReco — a
                    cheerful, free-spirited girl known for her
                    boundless energy and signature red ribbon. Despite being a former elite Lycoris agent, she chooses
                    to use her skills to protect lives rather than take them. She’s a master of non-lethal combat, with
                    exceptional reflexes and aim, capable of dodging bullets in close combat. At the café, she works as
                    a barista, greeting customers with warmth and enthusiasm — and maybe just a dash of chaos.</p>

                <p class="body px-3 px-md-0 pe-xl-5 mt-5" style="font-weight: 500;">Takina is a highly skilled and serious Lycoris agent who
                    was reassigned to Café LycoReco after a disobedient act during a mission. Though initially cold and
                    mission-focused, her time with Chisato helps her grow emotionally and socially. At the café, she
                    supports daily operations with efficiency and discipline — and slowly learns to smile a bit more.
                    She handles orders, deliveries, and occasionally customer service (though not always by choice).</p>

                <p class="body px-3 px-md-0 ps-xl-5 mt-5" style="font-weight: 500;">A prodigy hacker known by the alias “Walnut,” Kurumi is a
                    digital mastermind who faked her death and took refuge at Café LycoReco. She’s young, mischievous,
                    and endlessly curious — with a love for video games and sweets. Though not officially on the café
                    staff, she helps maintain the café’s tech and hacks into secure systems when needed. She often
                    lounges around the café’s couch area, gaming or eating.</p>

                <p class="body px-3 px-md-0 pe-xl-5 mt-5" style="font-weight: 500;">Mizuki is a former intelligence operative who now handles
                    the behind-the-scenes chaos of Café LycoReco. She’s the adult of the group — in theory — known for
                    her sharp wit, love of alcohol, and persistent interest in matchmaking. With her analytical
                    background, she helps with strategy and logistics during off-the-books missions. At the café, she
                    manages scheduling, supplies, and occasionally mixes "special drinks" off the menu.</p>

                <p class="body px-3 px-md-0 ps-xl-5 mt-5" style="font-weight: 500;">Mika is the calm, composed owner of Café LycoReco.
                    Formerly a DA instructor, he now lives a quieter life running the café and watching over the girls.
                    He has a strong sense of responsibility and acts as a father figure to both Chisato and the rest of
                    the team. Highly skilled in both combat and coffee-making, Mika balances his past as a soldier with
                    a peaceful present, though his quiet demeanor hides many secrets.</p>
